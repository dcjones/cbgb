CBGB: Computational Biology Grab Bag
------------------------------------

Often I find my self writing little scripts, that I may or may not every need
again. Some are very nice and consistently useful, others are disgusting hacks.
They are mostly all too small to warrant a their own repository, so I keep them
here, in case I need them again.
